Language - C#
IDE - Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop Application.

I have divided the project into the following classes.

- Form1 -> Used for Interface Events
- AmortCal -> Method "Cal" is used for calculating EMI and method "generateTable" is used for generating the entire table of EMI using arrayList from class LoanValueTable.
- LoanValueTable -> The class is used to store the EMI table in arrayList "loanTable"
- ArrayDateView -> THis is class is used for defining objects used in arrayList "loanTable" from class LoanValueTable.
